passGen is a simple tool for generating random, semi-random and non-random passwords

The tool allows to generate passwords based on input (user names) and a template.
It's possible to make both strong passwords and simple ones that may be useful as
first one-time passwords (to be changed after first login).
The output is formatted in a table which is easy to send to users' or
their administrators for example by an e-mail.
