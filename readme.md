passGen is a simple tool for generating random, semi-random and non-random passwords

The tool allows to generate passwords based on input (user names) and a template. It's possible to make both strong password and simple ones that may be usefull as first one-time passwords (to be changed after first login). The output is formatted in a table which is easy to send to users' administrator for ex. by an e-mail.
